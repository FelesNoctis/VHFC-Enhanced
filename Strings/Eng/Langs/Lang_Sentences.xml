						<eng>A strange rat bone. Great. Still, somebody could use it in the Secret Lair. They all looked a bit desperate.</eng>

				</Lair_witch_1>
				<Lair_witch_2>
					<01_Katarina>
						<eng>I’m getting bored with this filthy job. Let’s go back to the Lair and ask Saffi what we can do with them.</eng>

					</02_VH>
					<03_Katarina>
						<eng>*Gasp* What?! Even if I did, who knows what it would do to me?? I could turn into a... a spider or a... wooden chest with teeth! If you want to experiment, give it to that scrawny cat!</eng>

					<03_VH>

						<eng>What else is on the list? Did they have any interesting projects?</eng>
					</01_Katarina>
					<02_VH>
						<eng>This one says… “The answer to life, universe and everything”. It’s ticked off. But there is only a number.</eng>

					<01_Katarina>
						<eng>I’m disappointed. Where are my dark and stormy Borgovian nights? And days.</eng>
					</01_Katarina>
					<02_VH>
						<eng>Look around. Machines belching smoke, polluting the sky… no wonder the weather is mad.</eng>
					</02_VH>
					<03_Katarina>
						<eng>But that’s just silly. No, I think that the scientists stole the lighting from the storms to make the sparkling machines.</eng>						
					</03_Katarina>

						<eng>On second thoughts, that sounds much more scientific.</eng>
