						<eng>So here we are again, in the Realm of the Deathless.</eng>
					</01_VH>
					<02_Katarina>
						<eng>Allow me a slight correction. We are in the black heart of his realm. I have a very bed feeling about this.</eng>
					</02_Katarina>
					<03_VH>
						<eng>We will find the hidden death of this Koschei and deal with Harker, and we are out of here.</eng>

						<eng>How do we recognize someone’s personal death? What does it look like?</eng>

						<eng>Van Helsing, I am so grateful. You prevented Harker from using the greatest arcane power in Borgovia… and you basically handed it to me on a plate. It still needs a lot of work, but trust me: I will do wonders with it. Please forgive me if I skip the part where I tell you how I used your truly admirable fight for freedom to achieve my goal. I presume our duel afterwards would have been fantastic, but this spell only allows me a short time here before it drags me away. I suppose we'll meet again.</eng>

					<eng>Well, that was fun... Katarina, what’s going on? Who is this... Is it a man?</eng>
				</01_VH>
				<02_Katarina>
					<eng>A troublesome intruder! He just appeared out of nowhere and...</eng>
				</02_Katarina>
				<03_Koscsej>
					<eng>...and humbly gave assistance to Van Helsing, the great liberator of Borgova.</eng>
				</03_Koscsej>

					<eng>It’s not the equipment that makes the hunter, you know that, right?</eng>

				<01_Koscsej>
					<eng>You made it out. Good. You will find an Inkgate at the end of the next hallway. It will take you to your Secret Lair.</eng>
				</01_Koscsej>
				<02_VH>
					<eng>Hold on. First I want to know who you are.</eng>
				</02_VH>
				<03_Katarina>
					<eng>And perhaps you could explain why you are so helpful! I always find that suspicious in a masked creature.</eng>
				</03_Katarina>
				<04_Koscsej>
					<eng>The mask hides deformations and the scars, the reminders of years of captivity in a lab.</eng>
				</04_Koscsej>
				<05_VH>
					<eng>You were a test subject?</eng>
				</05_VH>
				<06_Koscsej>
					<eng>Fulmigati’s favorite. Once a powerful being, now only a husk of my former self. Until your heroic deeds brought chaos to the prison... and so I escaped.</eng>
				</06_Koscsej>
				<07_VH>
					<eng>You are doing this out of gratitude?</eng>
				</07_VH>
				<08_Koscsej>
					<eng>And revenge. Though the Professor is dead, his heritage and his allies still remain. This tortured soul wants them to suffer!</eng>
				</08_Koscsej>
				<09_VH>
					<eng>So you’re proposing...</eng>

				</01_Koscsej>
				<02_VH>
					<eng>You don’t say.</eng>
				</02_VH>
				<03_Koscsej>
					<eng>This place has a powerful device, a marvel of weird science. It binds this patch of the Ink into a loop that won’t let anyone escape.</eng>
				</03_Koscsej>
				<04_VH>
					<eng>You seem to be able to come and go as you please.</eng>
				</04_VH>
				<05_Koscsej>
					<eng>I have a particularly strong connection to the Ink. The one thing my captors weren’t able to take away.</eng>
				</05_Koscsej>
				<06_VH>
					<eng>Then get us out! Take us with you!</eng>
				</06_VH>
				<07_Koscsej>
					<eng>That’s beyond this one’s powers. But a temporary portal could take you close to the device. Once you defeat its guardians, we can disable it.</eng>
				</07_Koscsej>
				<08_VH>
					<eng>Why should I trust you?</eng>
				</08_VH>

				<02_VH>
					<eng>Ready for what?</eng>
				</02_VH>
				<03_Koscsej>
					<eng>A storm is coming, Van Helsing. You may find that your work is far from done.</eng>
				</03_Koscsej>
				<04_Katarina>
					<eng>When is it ever?</eng>
				</04_Katarina>
				<05_Koscsej>
					<eng>Fulmigati’s army has withdrawn. Somebody is calling them back. They are still a chaotic mess, but they will regroup. Somebody wants to see you fall.</eng>
				</05_Koscsej>
				<06_Katarina>
					<eng>Nothing new about that.</eng>
				</06_Katarina>
				<07_Koscsej>
					<eng>An alliance is what you need. This tormented body is no longer able to fight but my powers allow me to discover secrets. I can be your master spy and you can let me have retribution.</eng>
				</07_Koscsej>
				<08_VH>
					<eng>But if we’re to be allies, at least tell me your name.</eng>
				</08_VH>
				<09_Koscsej>
					<eng>A name... Yes, I used to have one. But that person was killed a long time ago. This wretched ruin of a man standing here is merely called Prisoner Seven.</eng>
